                    <p>Hi, my name is Meklit Cherie, I'm currently a junior studying Software Engineering at Make School. My main focus in this study is computer science, to be more specific it is Front End Web as a beginner of a computer science student I would say I actually like the classes and tend to further my knoweldge on it, and fell interested in learning new languages and want to work more on it. </p>
                    <!-- <p>Software Engineer with a background in Psychology and life-long dedication to learning.  Effective at combining creativity, problem solving and Project Management. Nothing lights me up other than knowing what I didn't know yesterday and making something that influences the lives of people. </p> -->
                    <p>My ultimate goal is to be successfull in this field and make myelf and country proud, coming from a third world country everything seems immpossible until you make it, so being able to set this example for my fellow people will be a dream come true.</p>
